#To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
#The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified numbe

for x in range(6):
    print(x)

for x in range(2,6):
    print(x)

for x in range(2,30,3):#this means in increments of 3
    print(x)
